## Goal
Most migrants and refugees arriving in Europe cross the Mediterranean. The purpose of this website is to provide
a rough overview by focusing mainly on the Central Med and by covering both maritime and political events.

## History

This project succeeds [bb](https://github.com/barbalex/bb).

It was deeply refactored to use new technologies and maximize maintainability.

## Used technologies:

- [create-react-app](//github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app):
  - minimize build configuration
  - simple updates
  - serve production app from static files
- [MobX](//github.com/mobxjs/mobx):
  - simple yet powerful state management
  - computed data like in Excel
- [recompose](//github.com/acdlite/recompose):
  - clear separation of logic and user interface
- [React](//facebook.github.io/react):
  - declarative user interface is a function of state
  - built from components
- [react router 4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router) with [react-loadable](https://github.com/thejameskyle/react-loadable)
  - splitting code to accelerate first load
