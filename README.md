## Goal
Most mi­grants and re­fu­gees ar­ri­ving in Eu­ro­pe cross the blue bor­­ders of the Eas­­tern and Cen­­tral Me­diterrane­an. The flow is massive and high­ly com­plex. This web­­si­te provides a rough over­­view by co­ve­­ring chro­­no­­lo­­gi­­cal­­ly both ma­ri­­ti­me and political events.

## History

This project succeeds [bb](https://github.com/barbalex/bb).

It was deeply refactored to use new technologies and maximize maintainability.

## Used technologies:

- [create-react-app](//github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app):
  - minimize build configuration
  - update easily
  - easily serve in production
- [MobX](//github.com/mobxjs/mobx): Computed data like in Excel. Simpler than redux
- [recompose](//github.com/acdlite/recompose): Easily separate logic from interface
- [React](//facebook.github.io/react): Declarative user interface. Built from components
- [Flow](//flow.org): Static type checker. Find errors before the code runs
